Selecting Sorting


Algorithm
	Selecting sorting finds the i_th smallest(第i小) record, and put this record at Array[i].
	
	The key is how to finds the i_th smallest record from the remainning unsortted records.


Direct Selecting Sorting
	Direct Selecting Sorting finds the i_th record one by one, and swap this record with the Array[i].


C++ Template
	
	template <class Record>
	void SelectSort(Record Array[], int n) {
		int i, j, Smalllest;
		for(i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
			Smalllest = i;
			for (j = i+1; j < n; j++)
				if(Array[j] < Array[Smalllest])
					Smalllest = j;
			swap(Array, i, Smalllest);
		}
	}


Feature
	Unstable

Space Cost
	O(1): because of swap operation
