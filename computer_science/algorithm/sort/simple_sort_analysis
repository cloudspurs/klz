1. Why insersion sort is quickest in three simple sort algorithm?
	These three kinds sort algorithm average time cost is all O(nn),
	why insertion sort is quickest?

	Sort contain comparison, move, swap.
		swap = 3move = 3comparison

	Bubble Sort  needs all comparison and more than n swap.
	Selection Sort needs all comparison, most n swap.
	Insertion Sort not need all(average a half) comparison(until the first less or equal record),
	and movement.
					Comparison	Movement		Swap		All
	Bubble Sort		n(n-1)/2					n(n-1)/4	3n(n-1)/4
	Selection Sort	n(n-1)/2					n/2			n(n-1)/2 + 3n/2
	Insertion Sort	n(n-1)/4	(n+4)(n-1)/4				n(n-1)/2 + n-1
