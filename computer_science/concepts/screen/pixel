1. screen size(屏幕尺寸): the length of screen diagonal
    inch: 1inch = 2.54cm

2. resolution(分辨率): the number of screen pixel
    for example: resolution 1920*1080
        there are 1920 transverse pixels
        there are 1080 vertical pixels

    with the same screen size, higher resolution has more exquisite display
    effect.

3. dpi(dot per inch)
    Google Nexus 5: 4.95 inch screen size, resolution 1920*1080
    dpi: sqrt(1920*1920 + 1080*1080)/4.95 sqrt: square root
