The fundamental premise of Solr is simple.

The part where you feed in all the information is called [indexing] or [updating].
When you ask a question, it's called a [query].

Solr's basic unit of information is a document, which is a set of data that descirbes something.
In the Solr universe, documents are composed of [fields], which are more special pieces of information.
Fields can contain different kinds of data.
You can tell Solr about the kind of data a field contains by specifying its [field type].
The field type tells Solr how to interpret the field and how it can be queried.

When you add a document, Solr takes the information int the document's fields
and adds that information to index. When you perform a query, Solr can quickly consule
the index and return the matching documents.

Field Analysis

Field analysis tells Solr whta to do with incoming data when building an index.

Solr's Schema File

Solr stores details about the field types and fields it is expected to understand in a schema file.

Field Type Definitions and Properties

A filed type defines the analysis that will occur on a field when documents are indexed
or queries are sent to the index.

A filed type definition can include four types of information:
    The name of the field type(mandatory).
    An implementation class name(mandatory).
    If the field is [TextFields], a description of the field analysis for the field type.
    Field type properties - depending on the implementation calss, some properties may be mandatory.
