Section II Integrated Technologies on Robot

For providing a more pleasurable learning experience and better motivate learners,
SLP(Robot Name) integrates many AI technologies, such as emotion recognition,
personalized knowledge graph, face recognition.

Learners can enter the SLP robot sytem through face recognition technology based on
the deep learning. With face recognition, user can login to the SLP conveniently
and quickly without entering username and password.

SLP can recognize learner's real-time emotion status from his or her facial
expression (e.g., happiness, surprise and disgust)
with the image-based multiple deep network learning through the camera.
Using such emotion detection technology, SLP can provide a more appropriate
real-time feedback for learners.

SLP can provide a personalized knowledge graph for the individual learner.
For each concept on the knowlege graph, the system automatically denotes
different level of the knowledge proficiency using different color. 

So, it can provide the personalized learner-robot interaction.

    Technologies: face recognition, emotion recognition, personalized knowledge graph.

    Moreover, by leveraging on the foreground camera on SLP, an emotion recognition engine
    is implemented to recognize learner's real-time emotion status from his or her facial
    expression(e.g., happiness, surprise and disgust), where the image-based mutiple deep
    network learning is uesd. Using such emotion detection results, we further enhance the
    interactive module to provide a more appropriate real-time feedback for learners.
    For example, when a learner keeps showing anegative emotions (e.g., disgust) during
    the learning process, SLP may query about his or her current feeling or directly
    suggest the learner have a rest to alleviate the pressure.

    In the process of learning, a personalized knowledge graph can be automatically constructed 
    for each individual learner, according to his or her personal assessment results and
    the interaction data with the SLP. For each concept on the knowlege graph, the system
    automatically denotes different level of the knowledge proficiency using different color 
    for the individual learner.

Section III Main Functionalities and Workflow

The SLP robot has three main functionalities: Learn, Report and Casual Chatting.
Example interactions can be seen in demo video at https://aic-fe.bnu.edu.cn/xwdt/xzsp/57270.html.

For Learn and Report, it currently supports a number of subjects, including mathmatics,
Chinese, English, history, geography, physics, biology and ideology.
For each subject, a personalized knowledge graph can be automatically constructed for each individual learner,
according to his or her personal assessment result and the interaction data with the robot.
Students can select concept according to the knowledge proficiency denoted by the learner's
assessment results.

Moreover, SLP manages a large volume of learning resources. Several types of learning resources
are currently available for each concept, including micro-lecture videos, quiz question, and 
teaching handouts on the key concepts of each subject.

Learners can view the report after learning or assessment to better know own learning situation.
Learners can find comprehensive evaluation and concrete advantages and disadvantages of each subject.

To provide a more interesting and nice interaction experience, a dedicated conversational agent (CA) 
engine is designed to support casual chatting with learners. The designed CA used reinforcement learning
model generate human like response during a conversation.
