Searching

Overview of Searching in Solr

Solr search query is processed by a request handler. A request handler is a Solr
plug-in that defines the logic to be used when Solr processes a request.

Solr calls query parser(request handler) interprets the terms and parameters of a query.

Query Parsers
    Standard Query Parser: just the 'lucene" query parsr
    DisMax: much more tolerant of errors, to provide an experiences similar to search engines such as Google.
    Extended DisMax: Is an improved version of DisMax.

Query Parser can include:
    search strings: that is, terms to search for in the index.
    parameters for fine-tuning the query.
    parameters for controlling the presentation of the query response.

Filter Query
    A filter query runs a query against the entire index and caches the results.
    Solr allocates a searate cache for filter queries.
